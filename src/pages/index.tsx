        <h1>Next + TS + Tailwind + DaisyUI</h1>
        <h2>Decision making</h2>
        <p>
          I created this starter because from now on I&apos;m probably going to
          use Tailwind + Daisyui for all my frontend projects. Tailwind makes
          writing css less painful and Daisyui is a fully featured UI library
          without the jargon and custom props that other UI libraries offer. In
          my opinion this is the easiest and quickest way to get a frontend
          project up and running.
        </p>
        <p>Warning, dummy text ahead...</p>
        <p>
          By default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from
          paragraphs, headings, lists and more. This ends up being really useful
          for building application UIs because you spend less time undoing
          user-agent styles, but when you really are just trying to style some
          content that came from a rich-text editor in a CMS or a markdown file,
          it can be surprising and unintuitive.
        </p>
        <h2>More Dummy text but in a header</h2>
        <p>
          What follows from here is just a bunch of absolute nonsense Iâ€™ve
          written to dogfood the plugin itself. It includes every sensible
          typographic element I could think of, like bold text, unordered lists,
          ordered lists, code blocks, block quotes, and even italics.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would have loved to write this text, unfortunately, it is a copy
          paste form the Daisy ui docs
        </p>
